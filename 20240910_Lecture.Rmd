I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r echo = FALSE}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

# Learning assessment 1

This is code for the learning assessment for P1805. It create "la_df" and then plots a histogram.

```{r la_chunk}
library(tidyverse)

la_df =
  tibble(
    sample = rnorm(n = 500, mean = 1),
    log_samp = sample > 0,
    num_samp = abs(sample)
  )

ggplot( la_df, aes(x = num_samp)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```
